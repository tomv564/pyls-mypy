This is a plugin for the Palantir's Python Language Server (https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server)

It, like mypy, requires Python 3.2 or newer.


Installation
------------

Install into the same virtualenv as pyls itself.

``pip install pyls-mypy``

Configuration
-------------
``prepend`` (default is ``[]``) list of additional command-line options to prepend

``live_mode`` (default is True) provides type checking as you type.

As mypy is unaware of what file path is being checked, there are limitations with live_mode
 - Imports cannot be followed correctly
 - Stub files are not validated correctly

Turning off live_mode means you must save your changes for mypy diagnostics to update correctly.

Depending on your editor, the configuration should be roughly like this:

::

    "pyls":
    {
        "plugins":
        {
            "pyls_mypy":
            {
                "enabled": true,
                "live_mode": false,
                "prepend": ["--python-executable", "/tmp/foo/bin/python"]
            }
        }
    }
