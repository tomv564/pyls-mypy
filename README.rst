This is a plugin for the [Python LSP Server](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server).

It, like mypy, requires Python 3.2 or newer.


Installation
------------

Install into the same virtualenv as python-lsp-server itself.

``pip install pyls-mypy``

Configuration
-------------

``live_mode`` (default is True) provides type checking as you type.

As mypy is unaware of what file path is being checked, there are limitations with live_mode
 - Imports cannot be followed correctly
 - Stub files are not validated correctly

Turning off live_mode means you must save your changes for mypy diagnostics to update correctly.

Depending on your editor, the configuration should be roughly like this:

::

    "pylsp":
    {
        "plugins":
        {
            "pyls_mypy":
            {
                "enabled": true,
                "live_mode": false
            }
        }
    }
